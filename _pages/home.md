<h3>Aims & Scope</h3>

There is a shortage of datasets containing 3D realistic geometries simulated using high-fidelity CFD and FEA approaches. To address this we have created a community-driven project to develop large-scale CFD and FEA based training datasets using high-fidelity simulation data to aid the research and development of data-driven and physics-driven Machine Learning approaches. Three datasets are currently available ([AhmedML](ahmedml/), [WindsorML](windsorml/) and [DrivAerML](drivaerml/)), focused on high-fidelity CFD within the automotive domain, but in future this will be expanded to other domains.  

This website aims to help users to find the latest datasets, including how to access and download them as well as follow their use in publications.

The datasets are the result of a community effort from academia and industry. You can find the full list of contributions on the individual dataset pages. For general information please contact:
