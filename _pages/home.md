<h3>Aims & Scope</h3>

Community-driven project to develop large-scale CFD and FEA based training datasets using high-fidelity simulation data to aid the research and development of data-driven and physics-driven Machine Learning approaches. 

This website aims to help users to find the latest datasets, including how to access and download them as well as follow their use in publications.
